#Note
The Faith has two sides: The Patriarch, and The Matriarch. The Patriarch is like the catholic church and devoted to solemnity, and chastity. The Matriarch is the opposite of this, they are mirthful, sensual, and prone to outlandish actions. This leads to no end of bickering, and scheming between abbots, and abbesses at each abbey. Even the sitting Patriarch, and Matriarch are in much the same situation. The First Patriarch, and First Matriarch, made this deal to stop the war between their acolytes. This was forced by the threat of The Tainted. This was also the impetus behind the Seven Houses banding together, and picking The First High King.
